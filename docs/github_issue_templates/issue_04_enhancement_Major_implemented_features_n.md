title: ðŸ”§ Major implemented features not integrated into main simulation
labels: enhancement, integration, phase-1
assignees: none
---

## Description
Several fully implemented and tested features are not being used in the main simulation, significantly limiting its complexity and realism.

## Unused Features

### 1. Trade Route System
- **Files**: `include/system/trade_route.h`, `tests/system_tests/trade_route_test.cpp`
- **Status**: Implemented and tested, but not used in main simulation
- **Impact**: No inter-regional trade simulation

### 2. Government System  
- **Files**: `include/agent/government.h`, `tests/agent_tests/government_test.cpp`
- **Status**: Taxation and policy systems implemented but not integrated
- **Impact**: No government intervention in economy

### 3. Loan/Credit System
- **Files**: `include/agent/loan_provider.h`, `include/market/loan.h`, tests
- **Status**: Complete lending system but no connection to main economy
- **Impact**: No credit-based economic activity

## Current Main Simulation Limitations
- Only basic producer-consumer interactions
- No government taxation or policies
- No credit/loan system
- No trade routes or regional differences
- Agents operate in isolation

## Integration Points Needed

### 1. Government Integration
```cpp
// In simulateDay()
government.collectTaxes(people, businesses);
government.implementPolicies(market);
government.adjustBudget();
```

### 2. Loan System Integration  
```cpp
// Allow agents to take loans for purchases/expansion
if (person.money < market.getPrice(food)) {
    Loan loan = loanProvider.provideLoan(&person, needed_amount);
    // Handle loan transaction
}
```

### 3. Trade Route Integration
```cpp
// Add inter-regional trade
for (auto& route : trade_routes) {
    route.executeTradeIfProfitable(market);
}
```

## Expected Benefits
- More realistic economic simulation
- Complex multi-agent interactions
- Government economic intervention
- Credit-based economic growth
- Regional trade dynamics

## Priority
ðŸŸ¡ **High** - Core feature integration for Phase 1 completion
